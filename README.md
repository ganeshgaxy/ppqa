<p align="center"> PPQA is a project not a standalone library which is designed to provide any software automation testing team with a framework that suites the corporate level standards and flexibility towards building your own test cases with good practices and guidelines. This project uses <a href='https://github.com/microsoft/playwright'>playwright</a> and <a href='https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-test'>playwright/test</a> for all UI and API interactions.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Playwright is arguably a one of the best automation tool available right now. This project harnesses the power of playwright and combined it with good test writing principles to better help integration testers come up with good quality test cases and test components/modules. This project will also explain the necessary guidelines a tester has to follow while writing your test cases. Currently this project is only suitable for testing web apps.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Yarn is highly recommended for this project/framework. Please install yarn if you don't have using below command

```
npm i yarn -g
```

If you are using this framework for the first time, see the below instructions to set it up. See [codespaces](#codespaces) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone this repo and open it in your VSCODE. After that open the terminal for the current project folder and start following the instructions below,

First time setup command in the terminal

```
yarn run dev-setup
```

### Prerequisites

Dev setup command take care of everything that is required but in case of failure, please update nodejs. This project also uses [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) for using workspaces

Use the below command to install lerna globally, if required as Dev Setup should have already installed [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) locally.

```
yarn add lerna -d
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get the project/framework usable.

This project has workspaces and it is present under *packages* folder. So in order to build the workspace library project simple run below command from the current project's terminal. This command will link the package to the current project

```
yarn run build
```

Install the necessary extensions mentioned in the Recommended Extensions sections, You can find them under *.vscode/extensions.json*

All the test files are placed under *tests* folder and the project modules are under *project* folder.

This framework design is mostly object oriented.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

You can simply use the playwright runner commands to run the tests in this framework

### Run tests individually

You can add the recommended playwright extension or simply run the below command to run cases by test name

```
npx playwright test -g 'TEST_CASE_NAME'
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
